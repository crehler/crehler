**Enterprise E-Commerce**\
CREHLER® is a certified Shopware Enterprise Partner developing enterprise online applications with higher requirements and expectations. The development of complex B2B & B2C e-commerce projects and the transformation of a vision to a high-performance shop system is our everyday life.

**Our services**\
We only work with Shopware. We create the online shops, from concept and initial design studies to implementation and integration of ERP, PIM and CRM systems. Even after the launch of an online shop, we are happy to assist and provide support and maintenance. We also offer a continuous analysis and optimization of the shop's performance.

**Plugins**\
In order to make a shop even more competitive, we are developing various extensions. We have already developed several plugins and published them in the Shopware Community Store.

**Our workflow**\
We think project-oriented and use creative working methods when developing the project. Our goal is to provide innovative e-commerce solutions for demanding requirements. We look for and find innovative solutions for all tasks. Our motto is: "Think, Design and then Implement".

**About us**\
We are represented in Zielona Góra (Grünberg), about 180km from the world metropolis Berlin. The team consists of 20 employees. We implement our e-commerce projects using the latest techniques and tools. You can meet us regularly at Internet World Expo, Dmexco and other trade fairs in Germany, Switzerland and England, where we will present our services on our own stand.
